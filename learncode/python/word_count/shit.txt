If not to the sun for smiling, 
warm is still in the sun there, 
but wewill laugh more confident calm; if turned to found his own 
shadow, appropriate escape, the sun will be through 
the heart,warm each place behind the corner; if an outstretched palm 
cannot fall butterfly, then clenched waving arms, given power; if I can't have bright smile,
it will face to the sunshine, and sunshine smile together, in full bloom.
